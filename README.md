# The Complete Guide to toki ma Grammar

Welcome to the repository for toki-ma.com!

# Getting Started

To get started with development, simply fork this repo.

From there, run:

```
npm install
```

You can then make your changes on a new branch and open a pull request to request them to be merged here.

# Running the Dev Server

To run the development server, simply run:

```
npm run dev
```

It is bundled with Vite, so the build times are remarkably fast!

# Running Tests

To run the testing suite, run:

```
npm test
```

We are working towards adding more tests overall, so any help in this area is much appreciated!

# Running the Linter

To run ESLint, simply run:

```
npm run lint
```

You can also attempt to auto-fix linting issues with:

```
npm run lint-fix
```

# Building for Production

To build for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

To preview production builds, run:

```
npm run preview
```

Note that preview simply serves the dist folder in a production-like environment - it will not build the production build for you (you need to have already made a production build).

# Creating New Pages or Components

This repository has Plop.js for creating new components and pages.

To create a new component or page, run:

```
npm run create
```

From there, select "page" or "component" and fill out the information requested. New components will be in `src/components` and new pages will be in `src/pages`.
